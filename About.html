	<h2>About Voice Ensemble:</h2>
	<p>Formed in 1995 as the NYP Choir and later renamed NYP Voice Ensemble in 1998, this dynamic group of singers has since explored music across millennia and continents - from the Renaissance to the 21st century, from classical to jazz, from sacred music to Broadway, from madrigals to folklore.</p>

	<p>Fuelled by a love and passion for singing, the choir has grown from strength to strength and has taken part in competitions as well as performances in school events and external engagements. </p>

	<p>In 2013, Voice Ensemble took part in the A Capella Championships for the first time and emerged champion of the choir category. Besides competition, Voice Ensemble also gives back to the society by engaging in numerous community projects such as helping to spread awareness and raise funds for the Nepal Earthquake Victims, carolling at Ju Eng Home and Ren Ci Hospital, and recently performing for the Active Ageing Event graced by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in November 2015.</p>
	
	<p>This year, VE is taking a different direction this year and stepping out from the world of choral music into the world of Acapella and vocal jazz. The club will be expanding our repertoire to encompass contemporary pop, jazz, gospel and even R&B songs.</p>
